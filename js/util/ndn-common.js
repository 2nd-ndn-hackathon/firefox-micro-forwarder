 * Use apply to call a function and then use a continuation function to process

 * append continuation to the argument list when calling apply, so that the
 * continuation processes the result asynchronously. Otherwise, immediately call
 * continuation with the value and return the result synchronously. This is
 * needed for functions which allow an optional onComplete callback for
 * asynchronous mode. For example, you can call:
 * function myOptionalAsyncFunc(x, y, onComplete) {
 *   // Do some stuff to create someObject.
 *   return applyThen(someObject, "someMethod", [x, y], onComplete, function(val) {
 *     // Process val and create the result.
 *     return complete(onComplete, result);
 *   });
 * }
 *
 * If onComplete is omitted, then the effective synchronous code is:
 * function myOptionalAsyncFunc(x, y, onComplete) {
 *   // Do some stuff to create someObject.
 *   var val = someObject.someMethod(x, y);
 *   // Process val and create the result.
 *   return result;
 * }
 *
 * If onComplete is supplied, then the effective asynchronous code is:
 * function myOptionalAsyncFunc(x, y, onComplete) {
 *   // Do some stuff to create someObject.
 *   someObject.someMethod(x, y, function(val) {
 *     // Process val and create the result.
 *     onComplete(result);
 *   });
 * }
 *
 * @param {object} thisArg The "this" value for calling apply.
 * @param {string} funcName The function for calling apply is thisArg[funcName],
 * and its last argument must be an optional onComplete callback for
 * asynchronoous mode.
 * @param {array} args The array of arguments for calling apply. If doAsync, then
 * continuation is appended to args.
 * @param {boolean} doAsync If doAsync, then append continuation to args for
 * calling apply. Otheriwse, pass the result of apply to continuation and return
 * the result. As shown in the example above, you should simply pass onComplete
 * so that doAsync is true if onComplete is supplied. But note that applyThen
 * does not use onComplete itself - instead onComplete is used by the
 * continuation function.
 * @param {function} continuation A function which takes the result from calling
 * apply, and continues processing.
 * @return {any} If !doAsync, this returns the result of calling
 * continuation. Otherwise this returns undefined.
