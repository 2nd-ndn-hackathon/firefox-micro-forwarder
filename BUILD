THE BASICS: NO BUILD REQUIRED.
The basic NDN.JS library and the WebSockets proxy do not need to be "built".  For the library, you can manually include the necessary scripts in a web page or include Helper.js to have it load all of the scripts.  

BUILD A COMBINED, COMPRESSED LIBRARY.
A more efficient way to include the library is to used the combined, compressed library ndn-js.js that can be made using the js/tools/build/make-js.sh script.  See the README in that directly.  While we try to keep a built version in that directory for convenience, it may fall out of sync with the library, so we recommend building it using the script if possible.
