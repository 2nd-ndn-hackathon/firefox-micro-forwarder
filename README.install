NDN.JS: A javascript client library for Named Data Networking
-------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC LIBRARY: NO BUILD REQUIRED
================================
The basic NDN.JS library does not need to be "built".  For the library, you can manually
include the necessary scripts in a web page or include Helper.js to have it load all of
the scripts.

BUILD A COMBINED, COMPRESSED LIBRARY 
====================================

A more efficient way to include the library is to used the combined, compressed library
ndn-js.js that can be made using the js/tools/build/make-js.sh script.  See the README in
that directly.  While we try to keep a built version in that directory for convenience, it
may fall out of sync with the library, so we recommend building it using the script if
possible.

To create a combined and optionally compressed version of NDN.JS scripts:

    ./waf configure --no-ws --prefix=<PREFIX_TO_INSTALL_JS> 
    ./waf install

These commands will create a combined version, combined version compressed using  Google's
Closure Compiler, and install it into <PREFIX_TO_INSTALL_JS> folder.

The compressed version is what we recommend including in applications.

DOCUMENTATION
================
The documentation is auto-generated using JSDoc.  If you don't have JSDoc installed, download and unzip from:
https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/archive/master.zip

To make doc, cd to the root directory of ndn-js and run the following command to put the output in subdirectory doc:
<path-to-jsdoc>/jsdoc --recurse --destination doc js

WEBSOCKETS PROXY
================

If you wish to run your own WebSockets proxy instead of using the NDN testbed, you must
build and install Node.js (often on the machine also running the ccnd you wish to proxy
for, but that doesn't have to be the case).  See wsproxy/README.md

THE FIREFOX ADD-ON
==================

Build first compressed version of NDN.js

    ./waf configure
    ./waf

Then go to ndnProtocol and run ./make-ndnProtocol.sh which makes ndnProtocol.xpi.
