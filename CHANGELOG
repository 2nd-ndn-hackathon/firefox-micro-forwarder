--------------------------------------

Changes

* Updated the main NDN object to use a TcpTransport by default for Node.js.
* Change all code to use new Buffer instead of new Uint8Array.
* Moved global LOG variable to file Log.js.  If you want to change the log level, change Log.LOG .
* Moved files in tests/ to tests/browser/ .
* Added test files from NDN-On-Node to tests/node/ . 
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1051 If a host is specified, the NDN constructor defaults to port 6363 instead of port 9695.

* Added NameEnumeration support and a test in tests/browser/test-name-enumeration.html.
* Updated security library to use 'RSA-Sign JavaScript Library' and 'crypto.js'.
* Removed unsupported Witness.js (Merkle trees). Rename Signature.Witness to witness (lower case) and it is just a Buffer.
* Removed unimplemented TextXML encoder, especially since we will move away from XML wire formats.
* Internally changed "ccn" to "ndn" in function names and comments.
* Added Interest.toUri().
* http://redmine.named-data.net/issues/1059 Changed file names to lower case. Applications include build/ndn.js, so are unaffected.

* Added Name.get which returns a Name.Component (not the component byte array).
* Added Name.size. Deprecated Name.getComponentCount.

* EncodingUtils: Added encodeToHexData, decodeHexData and dataToHtml.

Deprecated
* build/ndn-js.js and build/ndn-js.min.js.  You should use build/ndn.js and build/ndn.min.js.
* ndnProtocol.xpi. Use ndn-protocol.xpi which is the new name of the Firefox add-on file.
* ContentObject: This class is deprecated. Use Data.
* Name: Deprecated getComponent.  Use get(i).getValue().
* Name: Deprecated getComponentCount.  Use size().
